##This is a test. I repeat, this is only a test.  
Fear not, citizens, for the testing will be but a brief flicker in time, a fragment of your busy lives.  
...  
...  
Testing complete. Resume your daily routine.  
Actually, scratch that.  
Resume your daily routine if you must, but preferably, begin to live the life you wish. 
**That is the true test.**
